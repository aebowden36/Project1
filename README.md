# Project_1

Hello, 

This code provides a analysis to the question, what factor most affects the violent crime rate of a city? Using 4 sub questions:


- Does population affect crime rate? 
  
  Data: Data imported from census data using a csv file.
  Visulations: 
    - Bar graph of population by city.
    - Scatter plot of population vs crime rate. 
  Hypothesist testing: 
    - T-test 



- Does poverty rate affect crime rate? 
  
  Data: Data imported from statistica data using a csv file.
  Visulations: 
    - Bar graph of poverty rate by city.
    - Scatter plot of poverty rate vs crime rate. 
  Hypothesist testing: 
    - T-test 

  
  
- Does law enforcement density affect crime rate?
  
  Data: Data imported using a csv file.
  Visulations: 
    - Bar graph of police density by city.
    - Scatter plot of police density vs crime rate. 
  Hypothesist testing: 
    - T-test 


- Does education affect crime rate? 
 
  Data: Data imported from census data using a csv file.
  Visulations: 
    - Bar graph of highschool or higher and college or higher by city.
    - Scatter plot of completed high school or higher vs crime rate. 
    - Scatter plot of completed college or higher vs crime rate. 
  Hypothesist testing: 
    - T-test 



The violent crime data used in all 4 questions was impoted using FBI API. 


Limitations: 

Our greatest limiation of this code would be needing a larger sample of citys. Unfortually when searching for data we found dicrepincy and inconsistancy of reported information. 


Going Beyond: 

This data only offers correlation, not causation, so there are not many definitive solutions that can be drawn from this data. However, it does offer a jumping off point for further research and areas to target when attempting to reduce crime in an area.
